Shared Cookies on different subdomains
======================================
To allow fluxbb_post module to read fluxbb cookies you need to set fluxbb
config file to have:

 $cookie_domain = '.youdomain.com';

and
 
 $cookie_path = '/';

Clear cache and cookie from your browser, restart it and all should work.
